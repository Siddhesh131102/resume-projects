# PostgreSQL Movie Rental Analysis Project

##  Overview
This project explores business insights from a movie rental database using PostgreSQL. The goal was to analyze customer behavior, revenue trends, inventory availability, and store performance using SQL queries.

##  Queries Performed
The project includes SQL queries demonstrating analytical skills using real-world business scenarios:
- Revenue by Month
- Movies with Rental Rate Above Average (Subquery)
- Movies Not Available in Inventory
- Movies Rented per Store
- Top 10 Customers by Number of Payments
- Top 10 Customers by Total Revenue

##  SQL Concepts Used
- **INNER JOIN**
- **GROUP BY**
- **ORDER BY**
- **LIMIT**
- **Subquery** (Average rental rate calculation)
- **Aggregate Functions** (SUM, COUNT, AVG)

## Purpose
This project demonstrates the use of SQL to extract meaningful insights from transactional databases using joins, aggregation, filtering, and subqueries.
